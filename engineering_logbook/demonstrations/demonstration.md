## Video Description

The video demonstrates a ROS2 system consisting of a minimal publisher and subscriber. The publisher node, named "minimal_cpp_publisher", publishes messages to the topic "/project_1_example_topic" at a frequency of 2Hz. Each message is a string that begins with "Hello, World!" followed by an incrementing counter. The subscriber node, "minimal_cpp_subscriber", listens to the same topic and logs the received messages, confirming the receipt with a log entry "I heard: '<message>'". The demonstration includes unit tests verifying the correct operation of both nodes, ensuring the publisher sends messages and the subscriber processes them correctly. The tests also confirm the publisher's counter increments as expected.
